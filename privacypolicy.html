	    			<p class="statement">Your privacy is critically important to us. At Full Company Name (Short Company Name) we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don&#8217;t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can&#8217;t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
<li>We don&#8217;t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We don&#8217;t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our <a href="http://www.agraphicnature.com/">support team</a>.</p>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Short Company Name collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Short Company Name&#8217;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Short Company Name&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Short Company Name may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Short Company Name&#8217;s websites choose to interact with Short Company Name in ways that require Short Company Name to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Short Company Name gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.  In each case, Short Company Name collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Short Company Name. Short Company Name does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Short Company Name may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites but does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Short Company Name discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Short Company Name's behalf or to provide services available on Short Company Name's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organisations may be located outside of your home country; by using Short Company Name's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Short Company Name will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations, as described above. Short Company Name discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Short Company Name believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Short Company Name, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Short Company Name website and have supplied your email address, Short Company Name may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Short Company Name and our products, we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Short Company Name takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorised access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Short Company Name may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
